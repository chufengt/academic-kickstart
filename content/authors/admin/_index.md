I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/cs/index.html), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Hu](http://www.xlhu.cn/). I received the B.E. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2018.
I was a research intern from August, 2017 to July, 2018 at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/), working with [Dr. Jing Shao](https://amandajshao.github.io/).

My research interest includes deep learning and computer vision. I was also interested in developing more effective and robust AI models based on findings in neuroscience.
